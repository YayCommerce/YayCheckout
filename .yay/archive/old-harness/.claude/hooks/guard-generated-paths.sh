# Purpose: stop Claude's file tools from editing generated output. A PreToolUse hook,
# wired up in .claude/settings.json: exit 2 blocks the tool call and shows Claude the
# message, and exit 0 hands the call on to the usual permission check.
# Update when: a generated directory, or the command that rebuilds it, changes.
#
# Shell commands never reach this hook. Without jq it exits 1, which Claude Code reports
# as a hook error before letting the edit through.
